# rpi-temperature

This project is my first time working with a Raspberry Pi sensor and integrating it with a database and frontend reporting/visualization tool. 
I wanted to experience to complete "data supply chain" from data gathering, to database ingestion & storage, and end with refining that data for service via a deployed front-end

I didn't want this project to be just on my local machine, so I learned a lot about how to create a MySQL database that is hosted and accessible by an application. 
I also stood up both [Metabase](https://www.metabase.com/) and [Apache Superset](https://superset.apache.org/) for visualization purposes and I loved Metabase for this project and went with that. 

All my hosting was done on [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/). 

View the [dashboard here](http://metabase.corvidanalytics.com/public/dashboard/2faca06c-ff07-4e4d-8d66-4a61a0c504b9)! It's no longer active, but the data gathered is still shown.
